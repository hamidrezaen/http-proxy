I was watching the Computer Networks course from Sharif University of Technology, taught by Mahdi Jafari Siavoshani (https://www.aparat.com/v/3FS1m?playlist=1218061).

I decided to do some of the homework assignments and searched GitHub for the most recent available assignments for this course. I found this repository containing the second practical assignment from the same university and the same instructor in fall 2023.

It is a simple http proxy writing in Python.
